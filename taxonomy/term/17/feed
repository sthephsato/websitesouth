&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;This country located on the Equator and hence explaining its name; Ecuador is composes one of the smaller countries located in South America, but also one of the most diverse. The fact that in Ecuador you can find beaches, mountains and jungle in one country and can easily reach all of these by road make this country a perfect stop for people wanting to get to know these three regions in a relatively short period of time. Ecuadorian cities also holds some of the oldest colonial centers in South America, especially Quito and Cuenca. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Driving through this country will for sure make you aware of the intense and awesome nature this country has to offer. Andes mountains crossing straight through the country with the pacific coast on one side and the Amazon Rainforest on the other make that this country has to offer something for all types of travelers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Stand with one foot in each hemisphere, wonder at one of the Inca ruins that can be found here, discover colonial cities and relax on the beach, it is all possible in this country and even more in relatively small distances and travelling time.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
               
         &lt;/div&gt;
                           &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;People visiting the Galapagos Islands will be looking for a unique experience and will be rewarded for their interest. Visiting the Galapagos Islands is an experience few will forget. Most people visiting the islands do this with a cruise. The cruises on the Galapagos Islands give you the chance to spend a lot of time on the sea, enjoying the islands from the sea and on land. During a cruise you will have several daily excursions, going from visiting the islands and their sites to seeing and experiencing wildlife through actually scuba diving among it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;There are several different Galapagos Cruise boats most of them quite luxurious. There are some catamarans and actual sailing boats as well. Most cruises go for 4, 5 or 8 days. Only the 8 day cruise does visit more or less the whole Galapagos Islands territory. Most cruises leave once a week on a fixed day from Baltra Island as this is the Galapagos Islands biggest airport. On the fourth or fifth day they pass by Baltra Island again and drive the other five or four day loop. The more luxurious sailing boats have a somewhat different route and do not pass by Baltra again.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;In general the bigger boats and the catamarans are the most stabile boats. The sea is in general quite calm but can have some rougher weather, especially in the months of June till August. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The other Galapagos Islands Tours on offer are Island Hopping programs. These are land based programs that will allow you to stay on some of the four principal islands and do the excursions between them. In general these Galapagos Islands tours are offered starting with weeklong programs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Galapagos Islands Attractions; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The main Galapagos Islands attractions are of course the large numbers of fauna and flora that mysteriously lives on these islands. Following is a short overview of the most important sights and fauna and flora that you can discover on the islands during the Galapagos Islands tours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Baltra Island;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; The Island is very arid, and vegetation consists of salt bushes, prickly pear cacti and palo santo trees After being extend on the island due to an experiment, land iguanas were reintroduced to Baltra. As of 1997, scientists counted 97 iguanas living on Baltra; 13 of which were born on the islands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;BartolomÃ© Island;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; This Island is one of the few that is home to the Galapagos penguin which is the only wild penguin species to live on the equator. The green turtle is another animal that resides on the island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;EspaÃ±ola Island;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; This Island is known for its large number of endemic species. It has its own species of lava lizard, mockingbird, and tortoise. EspaÃ±ola's marine iguanas exhibit a distinctive red coloration change during the breeding season. EspaÃ±ola is the only place where the waved albatross nests. Some of the birds have attempted to breed on Genovesa Island, but unsuccessfully. EspaÃ±ola's steep cliffs serve as the perfect runways for these birds, which take off for their ocean feeding grounds near the mainland of Ecuador and Peru.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Fernandina Island;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; One of the main points of interest to visitors is the Punta Espinosa; a narrow stretch of land where hundreds of marine iguanas gather, largely on black lava rocks. The famous flightless cormorants inhabit this island, as do GalÃ¡pagos penguins, pelicans, GalÃ¡pagos sea lions and GalÃ¡pagos fur seals. Different types of lava flows can be compared, and the mangrove forests can be observed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Floreana Island;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; This Island known for its Flamingos and green sea turtles nest (December to May) on this island. One of the most famous Galapagos Islands attractions can also be found here; Post Office Bay, since the 18th century whalers kept a wooden barrel that served as post office so that mail could be picked up and delivered to their destinations, mainly Europe and the United States, by ships on their way home. At the âDevil's Crownâ, an underwater volcanic cone and coral formations are found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Isabela Island;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; Some of the most famous inhabitants of this island are GalÃ¡pagos penguins, flightless cormorants, marine iguanas, pelicans and Sally Lightfoot crabs. At the skirts and calderas of the volcanos of Isabela, one can also see land iguanas and GalÃ¡pagos tortoises.The third-largest human settlement of the archipelago, Puerto Villamil, is located at the southeastern tip of the island. It is the only island to have the equator run across it. It is also the only place in the world where a penguin can be in its natural habitat in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;North Seymour;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; This Island is home to a large population of blue-footed boobies and swallow-tailed gulls. It hosts one of the largest populations of frigate birds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;San CristÃ³bal Island;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; This islands hosts frigate birds, sea lions, giant tortoises, blue- and red-footed boobies, tropicbirds, marine iguanas, dolphins and swallow-tailed gulls. The largest freshwater lake in the archipelago, Laguna El Junco, is located in the highlands of San CristÃ³bal. The capital of the province of GalÃ¡pagos, Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, lies at the southern tip of the island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Santa Cruz Island;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt; This Island hosts the largest human population in the archipelago, the town of Puerto Ayora. The Charles Darwin Research Station and the headquarters of the GalÃ¡pagos National Park Service are located here. The Highlands of Santa Cruz offer exuberant flora, and are famous for the lava tunnels. Large tortoise populations are found here. Black Turtle Cove is a site surrounded by mangroves, which sea turtles, rays and small sharks sometimes use as a mating area. Cerro DragÃ³n, known for its flamingo lagoon, is also located here, and along the trail one may see land iguanas foraging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Of course this is by far a complete list and many other animals and sea life can be seen on Galapagos Islands tours throughout the different seasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                  
         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/5_1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="content"&gt;
                  
               &lt;div class="desc"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc25587683" id="_Toc25587683"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Quito&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Quito, another main Ecuador tourist attraction is also known for its historical city Centre, one of the oldest in South America. Located on the Equator you will find another of the Ecuador tourist attractions; The Middle of the World Museum. This museum is located on what was thought to be the Equator but later on in the GPS era, they found out that the Equator was located 500 meters to the north. This is where strangely enough one can find an ancient Inca Ruin, precisely located on the Equator. You can also find a small local museum here were some of the famous Equator tests can be taken.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                  
         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/4_1.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="content"&gt;
                  
               &lt;div class="desc"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc25587684" id="_Toc25587684"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Guayaquil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Guayaquil is Ecuadorâs biggest city with a population of over 3 million it also is the countryâs economically most thriving city. The city has a mild savanna like climate all year round with temperatures almost never below 20Â° Celsius. Humidity is relatively high giving the city a bit of a jungle feel to it. The city has a colonial center, but is elaborated with more modern neighborhoods and parks. One of the most important sights of the city and one of the new Ecuador tourist attractions is the Malecon 2000, a beautiful boardwalk connecting the city along the river Guayas. This boardwalk holds besides the usual cafes and parks, some of Ecuadorâs best museums, such as the Anthropological Museum. Another sight is the Guayas Ship docked at the Malecon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                  
         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/Untitled%20design_0.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="content"&gt;
                  
               &lt;div class="desc"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc25587685" id="_Toc25587685"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Central Ecuador&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Central Ecuador is relatively small compared with the size of other South American countries and therefore make for a great destination. The center of the country is mainly made up out of the Andes Cordillera going through the country from North to South. &lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â &lt;/span&gt;Ecuador also holds some of the highest volcanoes in the world such as the Cotopaxi and Chimborazo volcano. The region from where many of these volcanoes can be visited is the BaÃ±os / Quito region of Ecuador. Here one can find a route that is called the Avenue of the Volcanoes driving you through several natural parks often perched in between vulcanoes on both sides. The region is also known for the large number of waterfalls that run through this beautiful area. When it comes to historic sites the region also has quite some to offer. The famous and maybe most beautiful city of Ecuador Cuenca is also located here as is the Inca Site of Ingapirca. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The Ecuadorian Rainforest, locally known as âEl Orienteâ makes up almost half of the country and like in the other Amazon Rainforest countries, is very little populated. The region holds many species of fauna and flora. The main mode of transport in the region is by river, the main Amazon Rivers in Ecuador are the Napo and Putumayo River. There are some really nice eco lodges to be found here where one can really grasp the essence of living in the Amazon Rainforest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Argentina, the country of Tango and football, meat and wine, Iguassu and Tierra del Fuego, Eva Peron and Lionel Messi (or Diego Maradona) âtaste can differ. This large country in South America has so much to offer that time will never be on your side when travelling Argentina. Start of course with Buenos Aires the proud capital and home to over 10 million inhabitants. This is a city that makes itself feel, youâll feel the proud of this city when wandering through neighborhoods as Recoleta, San Telmo and Palermo and of course the popular area of Boca with its colorful houses and bustling energy. Many of the famous Argentina tourist attractions can be found in Buenos Aires. For instance see the famous Plaza de Mayo, where the mothers of the children and husbands who disappeared during the dictatorship of Videla in the 70âs are still protesting and demanding justice every day. This square is the heart of popular resistance in Buenos Aires and even the whole of Argentina.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;From here it is only a short walk to Avenida 9 de Julio, supposedly the broadest avenue in the world with 24 lanes besides each other. Another thing one may want to do when in Buenos Aires is enjoy one of the famous football games here filled with passion and conviction. The biggest and best known classic in Argentina is of course between the two big Buenos Aires teams Boca Juniors and River Plate. In the evening one should of course enjoy a fabulous Tango show in one of the venues, accompanied by a good steak and a nice bottle of Argentinean wine. This sensual dance with all its grace and passion will leave you flabbergasted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Besides its capital, another of the famous Argentina Tourist attractions are the mighty Iguassu Falls on the border with Brazil and Paraguay in the north of the country. These falls, a combination of hundreds small falls, are a true spectacle of the sheer force of nature in its most pure form. You will feel and hear the falls from a long distance away and the mist of water created by this force of nature will get you wet from a good distance away. Located in a beautiful national park, covered in Atlantic Rainforest, this natural beauty will provide you with some of your best vacation pictures and an everlasting memory of something so impressive and powerful. The area is known for it hot and humid climate all year round and with some great hotels make for an awesome vacation destination. From here it is also possible to cross into Brazil and from here head to Rio or the Pantanal in Southern Brazil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;In the center north of the country you can find Mendoza and its beautiful countryside. This region is the largest wine producing area in Latin America and combines two great Argentina tourist attractions; the Maipu and the Lujan Valley. For the real wine lover a visit to this part of Argentina can be combined with a visit to Chile and the Chilean Wine Valleys. Besides these worldwide known wineries, Mendoza has a very nice city center and good restaurants. For some countryside and outdoor tourism the Mendoza and Salta regions are also great destinations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;More to the South in the Argentinean Lake District one can find Bariloche. This area is great for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and in the wintertime (June through September) some of the best skiing on the continent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Further south starts the mythic Patagonia region where you can find El Calafate and the Perito Moreno, one of the biggest glaciers in South America and an awesome sight. Come close with a boat meanwhile you can see and hear huge chunks of ice falling into the lake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Even more South you can find Ushuaia, the self-proclaimed Southernmost city in the world (even though below Ushuaia you can find Isla Navarino, a Chilean Island with its capital Puerto Williams). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;As you can read Argentina has it all. This combined with good road and air transport possibilities, great food and very hospitable people; it is obvious that Argentina has what it takes to be a great vacation destination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
               
         &lt;/div&gt;
                           &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The City of Greater Buenos Aires is home to over 13 million people and with this one of the bigger urban centers in South America and the world. The city was founded by the Spanish as a trade port in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the city started thriving as an important port between goods from South America to Spain and vice versa. The expansion of the city started in the nowadays named neighborhood if San Telmo, the historic heart of Buenos Aires. In the modern history Argentina became a very important immigration country receiving many people from all over the world, mainly Europe. Almost all of these people had to come through Buenos Aires and all left parts of their legacy in this city. This is why Buenos Aires to a lot of people feels very European like and claimed the nickname the Paris of South America. People and lifestyle in Buenos Aires will also feel very European to some was it not for some of the typical Argentinean customs. Tango, beef &amp; wine, and football are all things that the average PorteÃ±o will take quite seriously. People in Buenos Aires are very friendly and genuinely interested in other countries and cultures. You will also find a very political motivated city with many people and groups moving the city at times standing up for their rights. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The city is made up out of 48 âbarriosâ or districts. The most famous ones are;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;San Telmo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;; known for being the historic heart of the city and home to some beautiful 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century architecture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Recoleta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;; The upmarket neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, full of parks, nice restaurants and great hotels. Here you can find a lot of cultural venues combined with some typical Parisian architecture and the famous Recoleta Cemetery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Palermo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;; a younger and hipper area where you can find some of the best restaurants, nightclubs and âbolichesâ in town. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Puerto Madero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;; the old harbor with dockland buildings, now restyled into high-rise and loft apartments for the lucky few. This is Buenos Airesâs newest barrio. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;La Boca&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;; and old time favorite, the old harbor area. Full of painted houses and with an atmosphere only to be found in this popular area. Also home to the Boca Junior Football Club, one of the biggest in the country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;As you can read Buenos Aires is definitely a city to spend several days without one boring moment. Culturally very close to Europe yet still very different. Great food, great people and lots and lots of culture, definitely a âmust seeâ in South America. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Located in the Misiones Province in northern Argentina the Iguazu Falls are considered one of the great natural wonders of the continent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Iguazu Falls is located where the IguaÃ§u River tumbles over the edge of the ParanÃ¡ Plateau this is where numerous islands along the 2.7-kilometre long edge divide the falls into about 275 separate waterfalls and cataracts, varying between 60 meters and 82 meters high. About half of the river's flow falls into a long and narrow chasm called the Devil's Throat. The Devil's Throat is U-shaped, 82-meter-high, 150-meter-wide, and 700-meter-long. The border between Argentina and Brazil runs through the Devil's Throat. Two-thirds of the falls are within Argentine territory.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;The tourist circuit on the Argentine side comprises three sections: the upper falls, the lower falls, and the Devil's Throat. For all sections there are boardwalks foreseen to get closer to the falls. Be aware this will be a wet experience. On the Argentine side of the falls it is also possible to make a boat ride on the foot of the falls and experience the wetness and noise from very close by. The junction of the water flows marks the border between Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. There are points in the cities of Foz do IguaÃ§u, Brazil, Puerto IguaÃ§u, Argentina, and Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, which have access to the IguaÃ§u River where the borders of all three countries can be seen, a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the three cities. Being located so close to the border this is also an ideal place to pop over to Brazil and continue your trip in Brazil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                  
         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/1_0.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

               &lt;div class="desc"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc25587703" id="_Toc25587703"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Mendoza &amp; Salta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Mendoza is the capital city of Mendoza Province, in Argentina. It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the Andes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to Aconcagua (the highest mountain in the Western Hemisphere) and for adventure travelers interested in mountaineering, hiking, horseback riding, rafting, and other sports. In the winter, skiers come to the city for its easy access to the Andes. Besides being a Mecca for outdoor activities, the region is maybe even more known for its wineries. Mendoza holds the largest wine producing area in South America and some of Argentinean most famous wines come from here. Argentinaâs most highly rated Malbec wines originate from Mendozaâs high altitude wine regions of Lujan de Cuyo and the Uco Valley. These Districts are located in the foothills of the Andes mountains between 2,800 and 5,000 feet elevation. The two main wine valleys here are the Maipu and the Lujan Valley. Most wines produced here are from the Malbec or Cabernet Sauvignon grape followed by the Tempranillo and Chardonnay. As the area is known for its wineries and countryside, it is no wonder that the region in the last couple of years got developed for rural and culinary tourism. Many of the tours here can also be done on bike combining the good life of eating and drinking with some exercise during the day.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;For more outdoor tourism Argentinaâs Mecca is definetely Salta. The town of Salta is a laidback semi large city that invites to hang around for a couple of days. The region is known as one of the upcoming places for tourism in Argentina and provides great day or multiday hikes, biking, and paragliding adventures. From here one can also cross into Bolivia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                  
         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/2_0.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;When talking about one of the most enigmatic areas in South America it is inevitable that Patagonia and even more Tierra del Fuego will obviously appear high on the list. This large piece of land, shared by Argentina and Chile is one of the lesser inhabited on the continent with on average only 1.9 inhabitants per square kilometer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The region is divided in three parts; Eastern Patagonia, Western Patagonia and Tierra Del Fuego. The Eastern part is almost completely in Chile, the Western Part in Argentina and Tierra Del Fuego is shared by both countries. From East to West, Patagonia starts off with long plains or pampas that stretch for thousands kilometers from North to South. More towards the East and the border with Chile these Patagonian plains start to rise to a large Cordillera located on the border with Chile. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Located in this cordillera one can find Bariloche, the best known skiing resort in Argentina and maybe South America. This is a great outdoor country full of amazing landscaped, lakes, and glaciers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;More towards the south over this Cordillera you will come to El Calafate, known for one of the biggest glaciers in South America the Perito Moreno. This is an amazing spectacle to see as huge blocks of ice break off of the glacier and fall into the water. The sound of this glacier creaking is a sound that will impress you every time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Even more to the South, crossing the Chilean border and back into Argentina you ended up in the worlds Southernmost region; Tierra Del Fuego. The one bigger city here, proclaimed to be the Southernmost city in the world sounds even far away; Ushuaia. Here in Ushuaia you can glare at the beagle Channel dividing Argentina with Navarino Island, the last island before you reach cape Horn. Ushuaia is located besides a national park where in the wintertime one can do some skiing and in the summer do great one or more day hikes. Of course are the boat excursions to some of the surrounding islands only inhabited by sea lions and penguins a must see. Ushuaia being an ex penal colony, does also have its history. You can visit the jail that was used in these times now housing a good museum about this part of the history of Tierra del Fuego. Also you can pass by the harbor, the last harbor for many ships before crossing Cape Horn, still one of the deadliest seas in the world. And also the last stop for many large icebreakers on their way to Antarctica to supply the several bases located there. You can even see some of the bigger cruise ships in the world passing by here as this is a famous cruise destination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Donât forget get the official end of the world stamp in your passport at the local tourism office. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;One of the worldâs countries with the strangest shaped territory must be Chile. Located on the Eastern side of South America it is a country that is over 6000 kilometers long but on its broadest point the country is not even 400 kilometers. The country, because of its long stretched shape, is home to several different climate and eco zones. In the northern part of the country you can find the worldâs driest desert, the Atacama Desert, bordering with Peru and Bolivia. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;This is the land that is called Patagonia and even more south one can find the rugged and beautiful land of Tierra del Fuego.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The centre of the country enjoys a more Mediterranean climate and this is where the largest part of the population lives. It is here that Santiago de Chile, the countryâs capital is located. This is the biggest city of the country and the economical centre. Close to Santiago one can find two other interesting cities; Valparaiso and ViÃ±a del Mar. These cities are very popular during the summer as they are located on the seaside and have nice beaches. They are known as very bohemian cities that attract many people from Santiago in the weekends who want to escape from the busy city life. Both cities are very beautiful located, ViÃ±a del Mar with the best beaches and Valparaiso with beautiful artist neighborhoods. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Besides these sights to see Chile of course offers great wines and a day or multi day visit to one of these wineries is a very pleasant experience.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;The most famous wine valleys are located relatively close to Santiago, mainly the Cholchagua and Maipu Valley. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
               
         &lt;/div&gt;
                           &lt;/div&gt;  
                                      &lt;div style="background-repeat: no-repeat;background-position:center center;" class="bg-size-cover gva-parallax-inner skrollable skrollable-between" data-bottom-top="top: -68%;" data-top-bottom="top: 0%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                                  &lt;/div&gt;

         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/1_2.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="content"&gt;
                  
               &lt;div class="desc"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc25587689" id="_Toc25587689"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Central Chile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Central Chile is the main populated region that lies in between the northern point of Patagonia and the southern point of the Atacama Desert. More or less in the centre of the country you can find Santiago de Chile, the capital and most populated city of the country. Located at about two hours from the Pacific Ocean where the Andes meet with the coastal plains, the city has quite a special feel to it. The whole year round the climate is quite mild but with the snowy mountains on the background you do have a ski resort feeling now and then. All government institutions can be found here and it contains the economical and financial heart of the country. The historic centre is not quite big but very pleasant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Outside of Santiago, at a 2 hour drive you can get to Valparaiso located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. Valparaiso is one of the favorite weekend and holiday retreats for the Santiaguinos. The city is located in a amphitheater like mountain filled with cozy neighborhoods made up out of brightly painted houses. The city holds some of the countryâs best restaurants and has quite the bohemian feel to it. Located just besides Valaparaiso you can find ViÃ±a del Mar. This all time favorite among the Chilean bathing places has an even more bohemian feel to it and you can see where that comes from. Many wealthy Chileans have a second house here and the city itself has quite a majestic air flowing around. The beaches here in the summer will be quite occupied, especially during the big international music festival taking place her every summer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;About two hours to the west of Santiago you can find another area that attracts many people, the Central Wine Valley. This is only one of the many wine regions in Chile but this is Chile's most productive and internationally known wine region, due in large part to its close proximately to the country's capital Santiago. Within the region there are four subregions: the Maipo Valley, the Rapel Valley, the CuricÃ³ Valley and the Maule Valley. It is located directly across the Andes' from Argentina's most well known wine region Mendoza Province. The Maipo Valley is the most widely cultivated and recognized valley and is known for Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. The Rapel wine region in the Colchagua Province is also known for its Cabernet. CuricÃ³ has both red and white wine varieties planted but is most widely known for its Chardonnay. The Maule Valley still has large plantings of the local Pais but is gradually being planted with better red wine varieties. The whole region has several big and smaller wineries and some of them have a hotel or guesthouse on the premises where guests can stay. These are real treats and beautiful and tranquil environments. For the real wine lovers it is also possible to cross from here into the Mendoza province in Argentina to continue this trip through the famous wine areas in South America. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                  
         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/4_0.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="content"&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The Atacama Desert is a plateau in South America, covering a 1,000 &lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt;km&lt;/span&gt; strip of land on the Pacific coast of South America, west of the Andes &lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mountains&lt;/span&gt;. The Atacama &lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt;Desert&lt;/span&gt; is, according to NASA, National Geographic and many other publications, the driest desert in the world&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;The Atacama occupies 105,000 km2 in northern Chile, composed mostly of salt basins (salares), sand, and lava flows towards the Andes.&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt; The terrain differs a bit over the region from Mars and Moon Like Valleys to desert plains, colored lagoons and salt flats. Because of close volcanic activity there are also plenty of geysers active in the region. The desert can be visited with a four or more day tour, spending the night in San Pedro de Atacama and having daily excursions to the different sites in the region. The landscape, the driest desert on the earth, together with the altitude and Andes Mountains &amp; volcanoes luring in the back, this is truly a hallucinating destination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                  
         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/2_2.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="content"&gt;
                  
               &lt;div class="desc"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="_Toc25587691" id="_Toc25587691"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Patagonia &amp; Tierra Del Fuego&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The Chilean part of Patagonia embraces &lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt;the complete Eastern Part of Patagonia and includes the &lt;/span&gt;southern provinces and regions of Valdivia, Los Lagos Region a&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt;nd Greater Island of ChiloÃ©, &lt;/span&gt;Puerto Montt and the Archaeological site of Monte Verde, and also the islands south to the regions of AisÃ©n and Magallanes, including the west side of Tierra del Fuego and Cape Horn&lt;span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Located on such an extreme location on the globe, this part of the world offers all the dramatic landscape one would expect from the world's ultimate land's end. Here the South American continent ends in a cacophony of islands, glaciers, icebergs and mountains. It is truly one of Mother Natureâs grand finales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Chilean Patagonia is itself composed of two sub-regions; the northern Aisen and, to its south, Magallanes. Aisen is home to Parque National Laguna San Rafael, while Magellanes hosts the incomparable Parque National Torres del Paine. Isolated from the rest of Chile by fierce storms and impassable mountains, Magellanes can be reached only by air or overland from Argentina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The capital of the region of Magellanes is the city of Punta Arenas, which first became prosperous during the California gold rush. Here you will also find the only larger airport in the area. At about 4 hours driving from Punta Arenas you can find Puerto Natales, the entrance town to the famous Torres del Paine National Park. The main sites of the park; Torres del Paine, the Cuernos del Paine, Mount Fritz Roy, the hypnotic waterfalls of Salto Chico and Salto Grande, the Grey, Pingo, del Frances and Dickson glaciers; the Pehoe, Nordenskjold, Sarmiento, Pingo and Dickson lakes; and the Verde and Azul lagoons. All of these can be visited during a stay in the park. In the park there are several lodges and luxury hotels that provide people with great views and excursions during the day and all the warmth and luxury of a 5* hotel in the evening. Of course it is also possible to do multi day hikes in the park visiting some or most of the above mentioned sites. Being such a great destination, it is no wonder that the park can be quite busy in the high season, but if you would go in the between seasons, you can have days that you feel like you are all alone in the park. The most popular route to see the park is hiking the âWâ called after the route you would follow. This route takes about 5 unforgettable days of hiking and includes at least 3 nights of camping. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                  
         &lt;div class="gsc-image-content "&gt;
            &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.southamericatravelsonline.com/sites/default/files/3_2.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Another one of most enigmatic destinations in South America, even though argued by some to be more Asian than South American are the Easter Islands or Rapa Nui. This island is claimed to the most isolated inhabited islands in the world, located over 3500 kilometers from the Chilean mainland. With a surface of just over 160 square kilometers the island is quite small. Geographically seen it belongs to the Polynesian Island group but was annexed to the territory of Chile in 1888. The Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called Moai created by the early Rapanui people. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. The climate on the island is subtropical submarine with most rain in the months August and September. Temperatures nevertheless almost never drop below 20Â° Celcius. The history of Easter Island is rich and controversial. Its inhabitants have endured famines, epidemics, civil war, slave raids, colonialism, and near deforestation; its population declined precipitously more than once. All this together make for a challenging and unforgettable holiday experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                           &lt;/div&gt;  
                                  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;When thinking of great holiday destinations, few countries can provide such a wide range of activities, sights and culture as Peru can. The country is made up out of large and extreme geographical regions such as the desert, the Andean Highland and the Amazon Rainforest, this together with a large and rich cultural history makes Peru a destination that offers you almost all different types of holidays all in one country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;When it comes to ancient cultures, Peru is a more than unique destination in South America. Most known are the Inca culture and the impressive number of sites and constructions they have left behind. The city of Cusco, Machu Picchu, Pisac, Ollantaytambo and Choquequirao are all part of the impressive legacy left behind by this mighty civilization. But it were not only the Incas who have roamed Peru in ancient times; Peru was one of the earliest inhabited parts of the Americas as can be deducted from the site of Caral, the oldest city found in the Americas and dating from about 2000BC. The Norte Chico, the Moche, the Chachapoyas, the Nazca, all these cultures form part of Peruâs lively history and all have left behind impressive works and constructions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Travelling to Peru does not only mean history &amp; archaeology, Peru provides you with some of the most challenging geographies for a whole range of activities. Hiking; as the country is literally cut in half by the might Andes Mountains, it is obvious that it provides some amazing hiking and mountaineering possibilities. Besides the very popular Inca Trail to Machu Picchu and the alternatives such as the Lares and Salkantay Trek, there is hiking to be done all over the country. Arequipa and the Colca Canyon, Puno and Lake Titicaca and of course Huaraz in the north provide some of the best mountain hiking possibilities in the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Having almost 60% of its territory covered with the Amazon Rainforest, Peru also is home to some of the most pristine parts of rainforest in South America. An added value to the great diversity of the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest is the fact that the Peru rainforest is relatively good accessible, even for a visit of 3 days. The most pristine parts of the Peruvian Amazon are probably Manu and the Tambopata National Reserve. Both parks are located at about 1.5 hour flying from Cusco and ideal for a 3 or 4 day jungle trip. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Finally there is the coast; the Peruvian Coast is more than 2500Km long and is the most populated region of the country. This part of the country is easier to travel as it is flat and the Pan American Highway runs from the border with Ecuador to the border with Chile. It is also here that most large cities are located. Ica, Lima, Chiclayo, Trujillo, Piura, these are some of the larger cities in the country. Cities like Trujillo and Chiclayo provide you with great ancient ruins such as Chan Chan, meanwhile further north around Piura you can find the best beaches in Peru, Mancora being the best known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
               
         &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The Peru coastline stretches over 2500Km all the way from the South of Ecuador to the North of Chile. The coast is mainly made up out of dry desert or semi desert land but this did not stand in the way of the countryâs largest cities to develop here. The region has been inhabited for thousands of years and proof has been found of some of the oldest South American civilizations that once roamed these lands. The main sites on the Peru coast for many people will be of course Lima and other large cities that can be found here. Lima is a large and chaotic city but is the true economic and commercial heart of Peru. Almost 30% of Peruvians live in Lima making it a large metropolitan city with over 10 million inhabitants. This also means that Lima is a city that is essential to Peru and worthwhile a visit. The city is home to great colonial architecture, some of the best museums in the country and close by some interesting archeological sites such as Caral, and Pachacamac can be found. In recent years Lima has more and more profiled itself as the new culinary capital of South America. Peruvian cuisine is gaining more and more international recognition and Lima is definitely the catalyst of this movement. Having great hotels, amazing restaurants, and endless shopping possibilities, Lima is a city that cannot be missed during a Peru vacation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;To the south of Lima one can find several other interesting cities and sites to visit. At about 4 hoursâ drive from Lima one can find the city of Pisco. Besides being home to the famous Peruvian liquor Pisco, the city is also known as a starting point to visit the Ballestas Islands. These islands are located just in front of the coast and provide a home to countless marine animals such as birds, sea lions, dolphins and even whales. From here it is only a short ride to Ica. The city of Ica is also known for its wineries and Pisco bodegas. Nevertheless the most interesting site to visit close to Ica would be Huacachina. Huacachina is a true natural oasis in the middle of the desert. Surrounded by large sand dunes, Huacachina looks like the oasis one would dream of when hearing the word oasis. At about 2 hours south of Ica one can find the city of Nazca. The city itself is not that interesting but the sites close by all the more; the famous Nazca Lines. These drawings in the desert, some over 1000 meters large make for some of the most&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;mysterious discoveries ever in Peru. They have been studied for years and several hypothesis have been elaborated but none can claim to have found the true reason and methodology used to makes these elaborated drawings of Monkeys, Condors, Alien like figures and other animals and geometric figures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;To the north of Lima you would enter the lesser known Peru but more than worthwhile the visit. Here one can find some of the oldest civilzations in Peru and their inheritance. Large historic sites such as Chan Chan, Caral and the Temples of the Sun and the Moon all are found in the north of Peru. The region also has some amazing colonial cities such as Trujillo, Chiclayo and of course Cajamarca, also an important Inca based city. Finally the north coast provides you with some of the best beaches in Peru; the most famous being Mancora. This region has great weather almost all year round and the waves provide for some amazing surfing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The city of Cusco (also known as Cuzco) is situated in a large valley with views on the over 6500 meter high, snowcapped Ausangate Mountain in the distance. In Quechua (the local language originating from the Incas and still spoken today) Cusco means âNavel of the Worldâ and was built as the Inca capital from where the empire started growing to the South as to the North. The original structure of the city was laid out in the form of a Puma with the fortress of Sacsayhuaman being the head of the puma. Sacsayhuaman was the fort and military camp from where Cusco was protected. It is made up out of massive walls lined in a zig-zag patron and used to have two large watchtowers on top of the structure. It took the Spanish several fierce battles to take Sacsayhuaman and hence conquer Cusco. The city center of Cusco stretches out underneath Sacsayhuaman and has undergone several changes after the arrival of the Spanish. The Spanish destroyed many of the Inca constructions only to find that many of the Inca buildings were too massive to completely destroy. This is the reason why many of the colonial buildings in Cusco are built on top of Inca Foundations. Nowadays this gives the city a very unique characteristic and architectural style combining the Inca foundations with Spanish Colonial buildings, balconies and squares. The city center is spread out around the Plaza de Armas (Main Square) and is filled with small cobblestone streets and alleys. On one side of the Plaza you can find the Cathedral that was built on the remnants of the old Inca Palace. Behind the cathedral the city start rising up against the mountain side and here is where you can find one of the most beautiful barrios; San Blas. San Blas is the bohemian and artistic neighborhood in Cusco and definitely worth walking through. Another main site to visit in Cusco is Qoricancha or the Temple of the Sun. This used to be the most important religious temple for the Inca and home to many important rituals such as the worshiping of the sun. It was this temple that made the Spanish go wild about Cusco as it was supposedly covered in gold and had large quantities of gold art inside. Nowadays the building is partially torn down and a monastery has been built on top of it. This makes the building one of the strangest examples of how the Spanish tried to incorporated the Inca structures and by this tried to eliminate the Inca culture. Just outside Cusco there are also several interesting Inca sites to be visited. Qenqo, a strange rock formation with amazing carvings, Puka Pukara, a fortress that was used to protect Cusco from this angle and Tambomachay a site dedicated to the rite of water. Apart from all these archeological and architectonic wonders, Cusco is also a nice city for travellers as it has a large selection of hotels for all budgets, great restaurants, booming nightlife and one of the best shopping in Peru (especially artisanal souvenirs).&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The Sacred Valley of the Incas is located at about one hour drive from Cusco. The drive takes you over beautiful highlands surrounded by snowcapped mountains until you start heading down into the Sacred Valley. As the Sacred Valley is located approximately 800 meters lower than Cusco, this is also an interesting place to acclimatize to the altitude. The lower altitude also provides you with a milder climate than Cusco. The Sacred Valley runs from the city of Pisac to the city of Ollantaytambo at about 50Km apart. Both of these cities are seen as entrances to the Sacred Valley and hence are protected with impressive defensive fortresses from both sides. The site of Pisac is quite extensive and besides a religious part also boosts large Inca terracing and great views of the Sacred Valley. In Pisac you can see the Urubamba River (some parts are called the Vilcanote River) snaking its way through the Sacred Valley. It is this river that provided the Inca with a large part of their crops. The river floods parts of the valley yearly, leaving behind very fertile soil. The Valley is relatively wide and flat, providing a lot agricultural valuable land. From Pisac the main road in the Sacred Valley takes you through small villages, many constructed during the Inca era, to the North West to the small beautiful village of Olllantaytambo. Besides the amazing site of Ollantaytambo and the original Inca lay out of the village, Ollantaytambo is also known for having the last train station to take a train to Machu Picchu. This gives people the chance to get to know the Sacred Valley, spend the night here and continue to Machu Picchu the next day from here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Machu Picchu; the enigmatic site of Machu Picchu is one of the biggest tourist attractions in South America and a marvel to see. The site, nicknamed the Lost City of the Incas is located at 100Km north east of Cusco and for many years unknown to mankind. It was American adventurer Hiram Bingham who had the honor to expose Machu Picchu to the world in 1911. There are several accounts of people, even foreigners, having stumbled across this amazing site in earlier years, but it was Hiram Bingham who first saw the true magnitude of the site and who started with clearing &lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â &lt;/span&gt;and mapping the site.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The site was probably built under the rule of Pachacutec, one of the great Inca Rulers responsible for many buildings and expansion of the Inca Empire. The reason for the site to have been built is still under discussion and as there are a large number of hypothesis, it may as well be that we will never know the true reason. Hypothesis goes from being a summer palace for the Inca Royalty to a luxury prison for preferential Inca prisoners and every possibility in between. The site was probably abandoned when the Spanish arrived together with the retreat of the Inca further into the jungle. But just as the reasons for the construction of the site, the abandoning of the site is also a mystery. One thing is sure; the Spanish never reached the amazing site of Machu Picchu, making it an even more important found in understanding the Inca. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;The site is constructed in the saddle of 2 mountains that border Machu Picchu from both sides. The mountain on the South side is called Machu Picchu Mountain (Old Peak) and the mountain on the North side is called Huayna Picchu (Young Mountain). The site itself is made up out of different sectors. The main sectors are the Agricultural sector and the Urban sector. The agricultural sector has been divided into the Upper and Lower Sectors meanwhile the Urban Sector has been divided into different parts; The Popular District, the Sacred District and the district for the Priests and Nobility. It is in the Urban Sector where you can find the primary archaeological treasures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-language: EN-US;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;When visiting Machu Picchu, make sure that you had the chance to see the site from one of the higher points as this will give you a good impression of the sheer size of this site and provide you with great photo opportunities. As the number of people allowed climbing Huayna Picchu has been limited to 400 people daily in two early morning groups, it may be possible that you do not get the chance to climb Huayna Picchu. Nevertheless there is a great alternative with less people and even higher viewing points on the other side of the site; Machu Picchu Mountain. This mountain can be climbed when heading for the south side of Machu Picchu and takes about 2 hours. The climb is less steep than the Huayna Picchu one and the views from here on Machu Picchu at least as rewarding. &lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â &lt;/span&gt;In any case spending time on Machu Picchu is an unforgettable experience and few sites in the world will provoke more awe than this amazing construction on an impossible place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

This lake located on the border between Peru and Bolivia is not only the biggest lake in South America; located on 3811 meters above sea level, it is also the highest navigable lake in the world. The lake is about 70 on 190Km and has its deepest point at about 300 meters under the surface. The lake has a special dark blue color and the contrast of the color of the water with the blue sky and snowcapped mountains is a true spectacle. There are 42 islands located in the lake, the larger ones inhabited. The most famous islands on the Peruvian side of the lake are Uros, Taquile and Amantani. The Uros Islands are artificial floating islands made out of flattened parches of reed in the lake built by the people living there. The history of the islands goes back to the time of the Inca when a neighboring tribe has to find refuge from the Inca and ended up âexiledâ on these islands. Housing and boats are also made out of the same reed giving the island a very exotic look for such a high altitude location. Even till the day of today there are families living on these islands. The island of Taquile may as well be the most authentic island on Peruvian side. The island has several Inca constructions and has quite some agriculture. The methods used here still date back centuries and people live on a different rhythm on these islands. Also the islanders are famous for their colorful clothing, dating back to the time of the Spanish Conquest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The city is located perched in between on one side the mountains and on the other the lake. Being located close to the Bolivian border, Puno as most South American border cities has a bit of a Wild West feeling to it. The city itself has some nice plazas connected with a pedestrian shopping street, but apart from this the city center has not much to show for. Nevertheless with the altitude you may want to take it easy when travelling around Lake Titicaca. The one time of year when tourists actually go to Puno for Puno is in February. Puno is proclaimed as the Peruvian Folkloric Capital and the main festival exposing this is the incredible yearly Carnival. Hundreds of local and international dancing groups come to the city to participate in a week-long festival of dances, parades, shows and competitions in and around Puno. The festival of course goes accompanied with sufficient beer and parties making this a crazy week in this highland city. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At one hour drive from Puno, on the way to Juliaca where the only airport in the region is located, you can find the funerary towers of Sillustani. These are funerary towers built by a pre Inca civilization, some of their building techniques being copied by the Inca later on. From Puno it is also quite easy to travel to Bolivia. The biggest town on the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca is Copacabana. From here you can visit some of the Bolivian Islands on the Lake and continue to La Paz about 2 hours from Copacabana. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Arequipa, also known as theâ White Cityâ is Peruâs second biggest city in terms of population but also in terms of economy. The cityâs nickname stems from the extensive use of sillar, a white volcanic rock that is quite typical for the region, in the construction of the houses in the city center. The city center is laid out in a dam pattern with the Plaza de Armas (Main Square) as central point. It is the main square that forms one of the most famous attractions of Arequipa as this is recognized as being one of the most beautiful squares in Peru. On one side you can see the proud cathedral with its two towers and on the other three sides colonial arches typical for the time the square was built. From the terraces on the second floor of the plaza one can see the Misti Volcano towering behind the city. Another main attraction of the city is the Monastery de Santa Catalina. This monastery taking up several blocks in the city center is one of the older in Peru and largest in South America. The monastery is partially still in use but can be visited. When it comes to museums, Arequipa does not have the quantity as Lima, but does have one museum that stands out; Museu Santuarios Andinos. This museum has a single exhibition that is the Ice Princess of Ampato. Ampato is a snowcapped extinct volcano where a mummy was found of a young girl. The young girl was nicknamed Juanita and the original mummy can be seen in this museum.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Besides all these places of interest, Arequipa is also a city with a very mild climate, amazing hospitable people and amazing food. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Located at about 200Km from Arequipa there is another record breaking destination; The Colca Canyon, the second deepest canyon in the world almost &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in the USA. The canyon can be reached from Arequipa by 3 hour drive taking you through some amazing landscapes. Passing besides the Misti Volcano and travelling through the Salineras National Park, known for its population of wild VicuÃ±as, a small member of the llama family. After the park you will come to what may as well be the highest point on your trip; at 4900 meters above sea level you will pass by the Mirador de los Vulcanos, or the Volcano Viewing point. From this high point (you are now higher than the highest point in Europe) you can see several active and inactive volcanoes in the distance. From here you will start going down until you reach the town of Chivay. Chivay is the biggest village in the canyon and most hotels are located around here. There is also a very nice hot spring just 5Km out of Chivay. The sides of the canyon are made up out of old Inca terracing. Furthermore as the canyon is surrounded by snowcapped mountains, waterfalls and amazing views, there will be more than one moment when you will be surprised by the beauty of this region. If this would not be enough, the Colca Canyon is also home to the Condor. This majestic bird, the largest flying bird on the planet, lives in the Colca Canyon and the Cruz del Condor may as well be one of the best viewing points for these birds in the world. The Colca Canyon with is amazing landscapes, colorful inhabitants, choice of fauna and flora and proximity to Arequipa make this definitely one of the top destinations in Peru.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;Â  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;Having more than 60% of the countries territory covered by Amazon Rainforest, obviously this makes for another great destination in Peru. The Amazon Rainforest is only bigger in Brazil and even though Peru has its own share of problems, in general it can be said that the rainforest in Peru is under less pressure than in Brazil. The two main cities in Peru to visit the Amazon Rainforest are Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado. Iquitos is located in the far north of the country and is recognized as the worldsâ largest city not reachable by land. The only two modes of transport reaching Iquitos are by boat or by plane. Iquitos is located on the Amazon River itself and an excursion into the jungle will start with a boat trip over this massive river. From here you will go onto a side river taking you to one of the lodges around. As the transport to the lodges may be quite long, jungle trips around Iquitos are best done for 5 days. The other destination for people wanting to experience the Amazon Rainforest is in the South of Peru. At about one hour flying from Cusco one can find the city of Puerto Maldonado. This city is the main starting point for trips to some of the most pristine parts of the Amazon Rainforest; the Manu and Tambopata National parks. Both parks are known for their abundant wildlife and the fact that the jungle from here is relatively easy to reach. Great lodges are located a couple of hours upstream on the Madre de Dios River and the region is full of great lagoons, clay clicks and jungle trails. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;  
         &lt;/div&gt;

                           &lt;/div&gt;  
                                  &lt;/div&gt;
